# "How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?"

MongoDB seems to be 'unstructured' vs the tabular data from PostgreSQL. This makes it very easy to put things into MongoDB, but pulling things out (and getting what you want) is a little harder for me.

I also find it interesting that I can just shove the titanic dataset into MongoDB, along with all the toy examples from the morning, and by defining the JSON Fields, it's almost as if we have multiple tables within the Mongo unstructured db, but they don't have a fixed relationship.
