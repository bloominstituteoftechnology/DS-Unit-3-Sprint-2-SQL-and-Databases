# How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?
# What was easier, and what was harder?

# I think the biggest difference in dealing with MongoDB vs PostgreSQL
# is the fact that MongoDB can handle NOSQL documents while PostgreSQL cannot.
# While it meant that MongoDB could take in more documents, it also meant that
# we had to be much more careful with the structure and schema of our inserts.
# MongoDB was also more secure, so sometimes I would find myself fighting
# security features when I didn't have to in PostgreSQL. Dotenv helped
# with that, but only to an extent.
