# The type of relationship between employee and territory tables is none. However once you join the table employee territory to either emplyoee or territory then you will get a one to one relationship. You can join a second time on the primary key, EmployeeID.

# Mongo DB is an object based documentation that handles and stores big data. It creates a dictionary where you're given a unique key and its value is a json dictionary(strings are keys and anything type for values) It is not good for querying data compared to sqlite or other querying languages like postgresql.

# NewSQL tries to blend traditional query language to NOSQL languages. Traditional languages follow the ACID principles and NOSQL is lenient on the A,I, and D principle(the C, consistent, is kept). Basically, try to use traditional query langauages on big data.
