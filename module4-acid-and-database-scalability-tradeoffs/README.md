# ACID and Database Scalability Tradeoffs

Comparing the costs and benefits of relational and non-relational approaches -
can we have the best of both worlds?

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and explain the advantages and disadvantages of traditional SQL
  databases
- Make informed decisions about alternative databases

## Before Lecture

So far in this sprint you've used SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. For each of
these, consider the following questions:

- What was easy about using this technology?
- What was hard about using this technology?
- What more would you like to learn about it?

Write a summary in the style of a possible blog post, and be prepared with questions and/or discussion topics into class. Bonus - later on, follow up and complete a real
blog post about different database technologies!

## Assignment

[See guided-project.md](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/DS-Unit-3-Sprint-2-SQL-and-Databases/blob/master/module4-acid-and-database-scalability-tradeoffs/assignment.md)

### Stretch Goals

Download the [Chinook SQLite database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) and practice making queries to it with DB Browser.

Using the PostgreSQL Titanic Database, how many married couples were aboard the Titanic? Assume that two people (one `Mr.` and one `Mrs.`) with the same last name and with at least 1 sibling/spouse aboard are a married couple.

The assignment covered core SQL, but *didn't* review joins - revisit the RPG
data, and do more joins (explicit or implicit) to make sure you understand how
to connect data across tables.

### Resources

Read up on [database
normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) - a variety
of formal techniques for reducing the redundancy of data stored in a relational
database.

Get more reps in! Check out [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) and [w3schools SQL
Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), both of which include interactive
exercises. Mastering SQL is all about practice, so continue to work on it regularly and you'll be
confident for your job interviews.
