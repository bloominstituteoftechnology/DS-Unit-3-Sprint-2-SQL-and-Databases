# Querying Practice

Go back to both your deployed PostgreSQL (Titanic data) and MongoDB
(RPG data) instances and practice querying them.

## Part 1 - PostgreSQL Titanic Data

 First query the PostgreSQL titanic database to answer the following:

- How many passengers survived, and how many died?
- How many passengers were in each class?
- How many passengers survived/died within each class?
- What was the average age of survivors vs nonsurvivors?
- What was the average age of each passenger class?
- What was the average fare by passenger class? By survival?
- How many siblings/spouses aboard on average, by passenger class? By survival?
- How many parents/children aboard on average, by passenger class? By survival?
- Do any passengers have the same name?

# Part 2 - MongoDB RPG Data

Use [MongoDB
queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) to answer
the questions from the first module (when the RPG data was in
SQLite):

- How many total Characters are there?
- How many total Items?
- How many of the Items are Weapons? How many are not?
- How many Items does each Character have? (Return first 20 rows)
- How many Weapons does each Character have? (Return first 20 rows)
- On average, how many Items does each Character have?
- On average, how many Weapons does each Character have?

Please compare and contrast the difference between these forms of querying and relate it back to the differences discussed in lesson today.

Please turn into Canvas your list of PostgreSQL and MongoDB database queries - this can be in any format (`.py`, .`ipynb`, etc.).
