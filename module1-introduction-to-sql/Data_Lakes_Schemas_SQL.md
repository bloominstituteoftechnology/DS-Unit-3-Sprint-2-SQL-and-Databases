**Data lake** = Where structured and unstructered data as well as a method for organizing large volumes of highly diverse
data from diverse sources"(Extaraction phase)

**Data Warehouse**: collects data from various sources whether internal or external and 
optimizes the data for retrieval for business purposes" (Transformation phase)

**Database**: an organized collection of data Databases are classified by the way they store this data

## Two types of Databases:
/Structured - SQL or RDBMS Relational Database Management System
/Non_structured -  NoSQL - Document Store

### Types of Data files typical to Data Science:

-JSON
-CSV
-Avro
-Orc
-Parqet

"These are interchangeable within AWS, GCP or Azure file types"

**AWS** : cornered the market on services available and name brand
      easy start up and set up, most widely used

**Azure**: user friendl-iest, less expensive but less accurate.....stuck with Microsoft Schema

**GCP(google)**: least user friendly, less services but high reliability
